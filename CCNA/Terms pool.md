**The medium**: Cables, WIFI...
**Protocol Data Unit (PDU)**
**Physical characteristic of the medium**: voltage level, maximum transmission distance, physical connectors, cable specifications...
**LAN**: local area network
Digital bits to electrical, optical, radio signals
MAC: Media access control 
CRC: The algorithm used to in Ethernet to detect errors 
Switch table: Switch MAC address table
MAC size: address contains 6 bytes
**ARP**: The Address Resolution Protocol requests the MAC address using the target node's IP address
Switch broadcasting unkowwn MAC: Floods
Hosts have?: Access to the shared physical medium.
IP header: Version,IHL, DSCP, ECN, Total length, id, flags, offset, ttl, protocol, chechsum, source, destination, optional, payload
DSCP: Differentiated Services Code Point
