Protocol is the rules that governs the communications.

Computers are using rules, or protocols, in order to communicate. Protocols are required for computers to properly communicate across the network. In both a wired and wireless environment, a local network is defined as an area where all hosts must "speak the same language", which, in computer terms means they must "share a common protocol".

Networking protocols define many aspects of communication over the local network. these include:
- message format
- message size
- timing, encoding
- encapsulation
- and message patterns

## The TCP/IP Model

Layered models help us visualize how the various protocols work together to enable network communications.

| TCP/IP Model Layer | Description | Protocol example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Application | Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control. | HTTPS |
| Transport | Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks. | TCP |
| Internet | Determines the best path through the network. | IP |
| Network Access | Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network. | Ethernet |
