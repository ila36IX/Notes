Computers are using rules, or protocols, in order to communicate. Protocols are required for computers to properly communicate across the network. In both a wired and wireless environment, a local network is defined as an area where all hosts must "speak the same language", which, in computer terms means they must "share a common protocol".

Networking protocols define many aspects of communication over the local network. these include:
- message format
- message size
- timing, encoding
- encapsulation
- and message patterns
## The TCP/IP Model

Layered models help us visualize how the various protocols work together to enable network communications.

| TCP/IP Model Layer | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Application | Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control. |
| Transport | Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks. |
| Internet | Determines the best path through the network. |
| Network Access | Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network. |
