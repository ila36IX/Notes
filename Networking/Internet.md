# What is actually the "internet"?

Internet is stand for interconnection networks, it is considered as a "network of networks" because it is literally made up of thousands of local networks that are connected to each other.
### Data Transmission

The following categories are used to classify types of personal data:

- **Volunteered data -** This is created and explicitly shared by individuals, such as social network profiles. This type of data might include video files, pictures, text, or audio files.
- **Observed data -** This is captured by recording the actions of individuals, such as location data when using cell phones.
- **Inferred data -** This is data such as a credit score, which is based on analysis of volunteered or observed data.

The term bit is an abbreviation of “binary digit” and represents the smallest piece of data. Each bit can only have one of two possible values, 0 or 1.

There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:

- **Electrical signals -** Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- **Optical signals -** Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- **Wireless signals -** Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.
### Bandwidth

**Bandwidth** is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second. Common bandwidth measurements are as follows:

- Thousands of bits per second (Kbps)
- Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
- Billions of bits per second (Gbps)
