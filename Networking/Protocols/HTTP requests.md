## GET Method

A GET request retrieves data from a web server by specifying parameters in the URL portion of the request. This is the main method used for document retrieval. The following example makes use of GET method to fetch hello.htm:

```
GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

The server response against the above GET request will be as follows:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
Vary: Authorization,Accept
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed

<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
## HEAD Method

The HEAD method is functionally similar to GET, except that the server replies with a response line and headers, but no entity-body. The following example makes use of HEAD method to fetch header information about hello.htm:

```
HEAD /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

The server response against the above HEAD request will be as follows:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
Vary: Authorization,Accept
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed
```

You can notice that here server the does not send any data after header.

## POST Method

The POST method is used when you want to send some data to the server, for example, file update, form data, etc. The following example makes use of POST method to send a form data to the server, which will be processed by a process.cgi and finally a response will be returned:

```
POST /cgi-bin/process.cgi HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 88
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<string xmlns="http://clearforest.com/">string</string>
```

The server side script process.cgi processes the passed data and sends the following response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
Vary: Authorization,Accept
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed

<html>
<body>
<h1>Request Processed Successfully</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
## PUT Method

The PUT method is used to request the server to store the included entity-body at a location specified by the given URL. The following example requests the server to save the given entity-body in **hello.htm** at the root of the server:

```html
PUT /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-type: text/html
Content-Length: 182


<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

The server will store the given entity-body in **hello.htm** file and will send the following response back to the client:

```html
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 30
Connection: Closed


<html>
<body>
<h1>The file was created.</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
## DELETE Method

The DELETE method is used to request the server to delete a file at a location specified by the given URL. The following example requests the server to delete the given file **hello.htm** at the root of the server:

```html
DELETE /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: Keep-Alive

The server will delete the mentioned file **hello.htm** and will send the following response back to the client:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 30
Connection: Closed

<html>
<body>
<h1>URL deleted.</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## CONNECT Method

The CONNECT method is used by the client to establish a network connection to a web server over HTTP. The following example requests a connection with a web server running on the host tutorialspoint.com:

```html
CONNECT www.tutorialspoint.com HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
```

The connection is established with the server and the following response is sent back to the client:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
```
## OPTIONS Method

The OPTIONS method is used by the client to find out the HTTP methods and other options supported by a web server. The client can specify a URL for the OPTIONS method, or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server. The following example requests a list of methods supported by a web server running on tutorialspoint.com:

```
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
```

The server will send an information based on the current configuration of the server, for example:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Allow: GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS,TRACE
Content-Type: httpd/unix-directory
```

### HTTP access control (CORS)

[more...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

- The server **must not** specify the "`*`" wildcard for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response-header value, but must instead specify an explicit origin; for example: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com`

- The server **must not** specify the "`*`" wildcard for the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response-header value, but must instead specify an explicit list of header names; for example, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type`

- The server **must not** specify the "`*`" wildcard for the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response-header value, but must instead specify an explicit list of method names; for example, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET`

- The server **must not** specify the "`*`" wildcard for the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` response-header value, but must instead specify an explicit list of header names; for example, `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Encoding, Kuma-Revision`
