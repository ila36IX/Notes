### Ethernet ports
These ports connect to the internal switch portion of the router. These ports are usually labeled “Ethernet” or “LAN”, as shown in the figure. All devices connected to the switch ports are on the same local network.

### Internet ports
This port is used to connect the device to another network. The internet port connects the router to a different network than the Ethernet ports. This port is often used to connect to the cable or DSL modem in order to access the internet.
