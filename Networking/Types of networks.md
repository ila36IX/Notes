### Ethernet ports

These ports connect to the internal switch portion of the router. These ports are usually labeled “Ethernet” or “LAN”, as shown in the figure. All devices connected to the switch ports are on the same local network.

### Internet ports

This port is used to connect the device to another network. The internet port connects the router to a different network than the Ethernet ports. This port is often used to connect to the cable or DSL modem in order to access the internet.

### Three Media Types

Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices, as shown in the figure:

- **Metal wires within cables** - Data is encoded into electrical impulses.
- **Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable)** - Data is encoded into pulses of light.
- **Wireless transmission** - Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.
