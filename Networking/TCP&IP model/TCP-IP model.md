## The TCP/IP Model

Layered models help us visualize how the various protocols work together to enable network communications.

| TCP/IP Model Layer | Description | Protocol example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Application | Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control. | HTTPS |
| Transport | Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks. | TCP |
| Internet | Determines the best path through the network. | IP |
| Network Access | Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network. | Ethernet |
