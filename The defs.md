# What is?

## Server

A server is a computer system designed to provide services or resources to other computers or clients connected to it over a network. Its primary role is to handle requests and deliver data, applications, or computational power to client devices or software.
## web server

A web server is a software application designed to serve web pages, websites, and web applications to clients (typically web browsers) over the internet or a local network. Its main function is to accept HTTP requests from clients, process them, and return the requested web content or execute server-side logic as needed.

## Application server

An application server is a software framework that provides an environment for developing, deploying, and running applications and services. It acts as a middleware layer between the applications and the underlying operating system, databases, and other resources. Application servers typically handle tasks such as transaction management, security, load balancing, and resource pooling, allowing developers to focus on building the application logic.

## App server VS web server

The main difference between an application server and a web server is their primary purpose and the layer of the application stack they operate on.
- A web server is focused on delivering web content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) to clients over the HTTP protocol. It handles HTTP requests and responses, serving static web pages or routing requests to web applications.
- An application server, on the other hand, is designed to host and run application logic and business rules. It provides an environment for executing application code (e.g., Java, .NET) and integrating with databases, messaging systems, and other enterprise services. An application server typically sits behind a web server, processing requests from the web server and returning dynamic content or data.
## OS

Collection of software to facilitate interaction with hardware.
