# C signals

A signal is the way of communicating between processes, The arrival of a signal informs a process that some event or exceptional condition has occurred.
Each signal type is identified by a different integer, defined with symbolic names of
the form SIGxxxx.
Signals are sent to a process by the kernel, by another process (with suitable
permissions), or by the process itself. For example, the kernel may send a signal to
a process when one of the following occurs:
- the user typed the interrupt character (usually Control-C) on the keyboard;
- one of the processâ€™s children has terminated;
- a timer (alarm clock) set by the process has expired; or
- the process attempted to access an invalid memory address.
For example a segmentation fault that accrues when a program tries to access invalid memory area is indicator of receiving a `SEGV` signal by the kernel, by default a pogrom that receives a `SEGV` will terminates, but overriding this behaviors is possible by adding a specific handler function for this event.

The only signal that can not change its handler is the `SIGKILL`, it integer representation is '9'.

```
kill -9 <pid>
```

`kill` here doesn't always mean killing the process, it's used to send a signal to a process (not all signals meant to terminate the process).

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main()
{
	int pid = fork();

	if (pid == -1)
		return (1);
	// child process with the id of pid will run
	if (pid == 0)
	{
		while (1)
		{
			printf("Hello alien! ðŸ˜„\n");
			usleep(100000);
		}
	}
	else
	{
		// the parent process will wait 1s and than terminates its child precess
		sleep(1);
		// sending segkill signal to the pid process
		kill(pid, SIGKILL);
		printf("Dye mf!");
		wait(NULL);
	}
	return (0);
}

```

## Control stop/continue a process

In this program the program the child process will receive a stop signal, and will stop `1s` and then will continue its execution `1s` than get killed by its parent. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>


int main()
{
	int pid = fork();

	if (pid == -1)
		return (1);
	if (pid == 0)
	{
		while (1)
		{
			printf("Hello alien!\n");
			usleep(100000);
		}
	}
	else
	{
		kill(pid, SIGSTOP);
		printf("Process is in asleep\n");
		sleep(1);
		kill(pid, SIGCONT);
		sleep(1);
		kill(pid, SIGKILL);
		printf("Dye haney!");
		wait(NULL);
	}
	return (0);
}
```


## Meet your sender

It important sometimes to get who the sender is (its `pid`) so we can send back signals to acknowledges the receiving of the signal.
To do this you can use `sigaction` function as the following:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>

void handle_bit(int signo, siginfo_t *info, void *context) {
    // Declare a variable to store the sender's process ID
    pid_t sender_pid;

    // Extract the sender's process ID from the siginfo_t structure
    sender_pid = info->si_pid; 

    // Send a SIGUSR1 signal back to the sender
    kill(sender_pid, SIGUSR1); 
}

int main() {
    struct sigaction sa = {0}; 
    
    // the programm will call `handle_bit` if it revcieved a signal
    sa.sa_sigaction = handle_bit; 

    // Enable SA_SIGINFO flag to receive more information about the signal
    sa.sa_flags = SA_SIGINFO; 
    // Register the signal handler for SIGUSR1
    sigaction(SIGUSR1, &sa, NULL); 

    // stop the program intill it recieves a signal
    while (1) {
        pause(); 
    }

    return 0;
}
```
