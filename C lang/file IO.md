# C - File I/O

## File Descriptors (FD)

**It is an integer that uniquely represents an opened file of the process.**

- When you open a file, the operating system creates an **entry** (information about file) to represent that file.
- These **entries** are represented by *integers* like (100, 101, 102....): This entry number is the **File Descriptor**.

**To paint a clearer picture..**

- In Linux/Unix, everything is a file (Regular file, Directories, and even Devices are files)
- Every File has an associated number called **File Descriptor (FD)**.
  - Your screen also has a File Descriptor.
  - When a program is executed the output is sent to File Descriptor of the *screen*
  - Then you'll see program output on your *monitor*.
  - Or... If the output is sent to File Descriptor of the printer
  - The program output would have been printed.


In fact, in ``linux``, you can see the open fds with:

```bash
$ ls /proc/$$/fd      // Output: 0 1 2 10 12 255
                      // You can geuss what 0, 1, 2 are for 😎
```

## Standard File Descriptors

Whenever you execute a program/command at the terminal, 3 files are always open and a file descripter is associated with each of these files.

| File            | POSIX    | File Descriptor |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| standard input  | `stdin`  | 0               |
| standard output | `stdour` | 1               |
| standard error  | `stderr` | 2               |

## Input/Output System Calls

### 1. create()

The `create()` function is used to create a new empty file in C:

```c
#inlclude <unistd.h>    // (Unix standard header) The permission and the name
#include <fcntl.h>      // (File Control) For the flags
```
  
Syntax of create() in C

```c
int create(char *filename, mode_t mode);
```

- **Parameter**
`filename`: name of the file which you want to create
`mode`: indicates permissions of the new file.
- **Return Value**
  - return first unused file descriptor
  - return `-1` when an error

How C create() works in OS
1. Create a new empty file on the disk.
2. Create file table entry.
3. Set the first unused file descriptor to point to the file table entry.
4. Return file descriptor used, -1 upon failure.
### 2. open()

The `open()` function in C is used to open the file for reading, writing, or both. It is also capable of creating the file if it does not exist.

Syntax of open() in C

```c
int open (const char* Path, int flags);
```

- **Parameters**
`Path`: Path to the file which we want to open.
`flags`: It is used to specify how you want to open the file. We can use the following flags.

- **Return value**
  - return first unused file descriptor
  - return `-1` when an error

Some flags:

| Description                                                      | Flags        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Opens the file in read-only mode.                                | `O_RDONLY`   |
| Opens the file in write-only mode.                               | `O_WRONLY`   |
| Opens the file in read and write mode.                           | `O_RDWR`     |
| Create a file if it doesn’t exist.                               | `O_CREAT`    |
| Prevent creation if it already exists.                           | `O_EXCL`     |
| Opens the file and places the cursor at the end of the contents. | `O_ APPEND`  |
| Enable input and output control by signal.                       | `O_ASYNC`    |
| Enable close-on-exec mode on the open file.                      | `O_CLOEXEC`  |
| Disables blocking of the file opened.                            | `O_NONBLOCK` |
| Create an unnamed temporary file at the specified path.          | `O_TMPFILE`  |

Example of C `open()`  

```c
#include <fcntl.h>   // File control
#include <stdio.h>   // Standrad I/O
#include <unistd.h>  // Unix standard header

int main()
{
    // if file does not have in directory
    // then file foo.txt is created.
    int fd = open("foo.txt", O_RDONLY | O_CREAT);
    printf("fd = %d\n", fd);
    if (fd == -1) {
        // If program failed
        printf("Error");
    }
    return 0;
}

```

### 3. close()

The `close()` function in C tells the operating system that you are done with a file descriptor and closes the file pointed by the file descriptor.

Syntax of close() in C

```c
int close(int fd);
```

- **Parameter**
`fd`: File descriptor of the file that you want to close.

- **Return Value**
  - `0` on success.
  - `-1` on error.

Example of C `close()`

 ```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<fcntl.h>
int main()

{
    // assume that foo.txt is already created
    int fd1 = open("foo.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    close(fd1);
    exit(0);

}
```
### 4. read()

The `read()` function reads the specified amount of bytes `cnt` of input into the memory area indicated by `buf`.

Syntax of `read()` in C

```c
size_t read (int fd, void* buf, size_t cnt);
```

- **Parameters**
`fd`: file descriptor of the file from which data is to be read.
`buf`: buffer to read data from
`cnt`: length of the buffer
- **Return Value**
  - return Number of bytes read on success
  - return 0 on reaching the end of file
  - return -1 on error
  - return -1 on signal interrupt

Example of `read()` in C

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
    int fd, sz;
    char* c = (char*) calloc(100, sizeof(char));
    
    fd = open("foo.txt", O_RDONLY);
    sz = read(fd, c, 10);
    c[sz] = '\0';
    printf("Those bytes are as follows: %s\n", c);
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. write()

Writes `cnt` bytes from `buf` to the file or socket associated with fd. cnt should not be greater than `INT_MAX`.

Syntax of `write()` in C

```c
size_t write (int fd, void* buf, size_t cnt);
```

**Parameters**
`fd`: file descriptor
`buf`: buffer to write data to.
`cnt`: length of the buffer.

**Return Value**
- returns the number of bytes written on success.
- return 0 on reaching the End of File.
- return -1 on error.
- return -1 on signal interrupts.

Example of `write()` in C

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
void main()
{
	int sz;
	int fd = open("foo.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);

	if (fd < 0)
	{
	    perror("r1");
	    exit(1);
	}
	sz = write(fd, "hello geeks\n", strlen("hello geeks\n"));
	close(fd);
}
```
