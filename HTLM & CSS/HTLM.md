## What Are Semantic HTML Tags?

Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain.

## HTML semantic tags for structure

- `<header>`: The header tag defines content that should be considered the introductory information of a page or section
- `<nav>`: The navigation tag is used for navigation links. It can be nested within the `<header>` tag, but secondary navigation `<nav>` tags are also commonly used elsewhere on the page.
- `<main>`: This tag contains the main content (also called the body) of a page. There should be only one tag per page.
- `<article>`: The article tag defines content that could stand independently of the page or site it’s on. It does not necessarily mean a “blog post.” Think of it more as “an article of clothing”—a self-contained item that can be used in various contexts.
- `<section>`: Using `<section>` is a way of grouping nearby content of a similar theme. A section tag differs from an article tag. It isn’t necessarily self-contained, but it forms part of something else. 
- `<aside>`: An aside element defines content that’s less important. It’s often used for sidebars—areas that add complementary but nonessential information.
- `<footer>`: You use `<footer>` at the bottom of a page. It usually includes contact information, copyright information, and some site navigation.

## HTML semantic tags for text

- `<h1>` (heading): The H1 tag marks the top level heading. There’s usually only one H1 heading per page.
- `<h2>` to `<h6>` (subheadings): The subheadings of various levels of importance. There can be multiple headings of the same level on a single page. 
- `<p>` (paragraph): A standalone paragraph of text.
- `<a>` (anchor): Used to mark up a hyperlink from one page to another.
- `<ol>` (ordered list): A list of items that are displayed in a particular order, starting with bullet points. One `<li>` (list item) tag contains a single item in the list.
- `<ul>` (unordered list): A list of items that do not need to be displayed in a particular order, starting with ordinal numbers. One `<li>` (list item) tag contains a single item of the list. 
- `<q>` / `<blockquote>`: A quotation of the text. Use `<blockquote>` for long, multi-line quotations and `<q>` for shorter, inline quotations.
- `<em>` (emphasis): Used for text that should be emphasized.
- `<strong>` (strong emphasis): Used for text that should be strongly emphasized.
- `<code>`: A block of computer code.

### Specificity

The ID selector has a higher specificity weight than the class selector, and the class selector has a higher specificity weight than the type selector.

**ID > class > type_type**
