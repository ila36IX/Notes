## Challenges

Due to the extended time spent on some tasks that have taken more time that we expected, we're now hardly past our deadlines.
Also due to not being strict about how the UI of the app will appear, we found ourselves working on a CSS without even knowing what we are building, it's a mess; I know, but we will figure it out!
The database design That I made contained 12 tables and all related to each other, which made writing code for the ORM harder than walking in hell, that caused me to be afraid that the app will certainly fail because of the complexity that I want to build an abstraction layer on above it, if it works will be just like magic and that is the vision but if it breaks will be a goddamn idiotic piece of shit that could week me up in the middle of the night, BUT for sure it not impossible! I have come to one conclusion: The tests MUST be done; that needs more time, effort, and bigger delay  with meeting the deadlines.

## Collaboration

From the beginning we’ve agreed me and my partner to split the project to two main tasks: UI and backend, until now I still don’t have any freaking idea how the UI will appear, and how the HTML and CSS is written, I’ve been really clear that the task is not about building a static visual app, it’s all about building pieces and components that will be reasonable working with them when we will make the app dynamic, It's not just about making it work; it's about making it easy to work with and not requiring us to go back and debug it later. Having to redo what should have been done right the first time is really a fucking bad idea!

I still haven’t seen the code until now! I tried really hard to make myself clear about how important it is to give an overview of what we have done, and use GitHub to make each other aware of the work that has been done by the other, no committed code in the repo from my partner is noticed, and I’m scared of the clue of what the next commit could contains.

But that doesn't mean that I’m mad! I’m ready to help my partner to finish his task in the best way possible (at least from our current level of knowledge) and make sure that our application is written in the way that should it be written, we will figure it out; *at the end we are here to learn, right?* I do not see myself perfect, I’m full of bullshit, and misinformation but at least I’m learning and I try to do everything in the right way (not about making it work, remember?).
## Project Updates

We are NOT planning to change any of our project deliverables, we’ve been honest with ourselves from the beginning as we are aware of our capabilities, so what we decide to build will not make us overwhelmed, but at the some time it’s not too easy, it’s just in the level where it’s a challenge but an achievable challenge.
## Progress…

I could rate our progress in this week with 2/10 , as we are not a head of our planned deadlines, the static front that I planned to be ready in 5 days, still not ready, and also there is no obvious goal, I was hopping at least all the elements of the app to be ready, not the code! just the UI design that really disappointed me. I hate being in the position of doing things randomly without a plane and it's worse if that thing is CSS. I hate it more than you could imagine.
The backend stuff is also taking more time than I planned, but I have achieved the migration of database design using SQLalchemy, and also built a massive amount of data to do tests, and now the database is ready and also full of pseudo data. Next task is making this database alive by hosting it in a server using the RESTful API.
