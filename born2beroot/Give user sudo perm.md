## What is a VM?

First of all you need to know what are you doing, a good start is to know what the [virtual  machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) is? how it works, and why the hell we need to simulate a machine inside our original machine (or the host machine `:)`).

- What is the host machine?
- what is the guest machine?

First add the user to the sudo group:

```bash
sudo usermod -a|--append -G|--groups group1,group2,... username

# Add to sudo group
sudo usermod -aG aljbari42 sudo
```

### The groups the the user belong to

```
groups alien
```
